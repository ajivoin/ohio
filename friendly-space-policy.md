OHI/O is dedicated to providing a harassment-free venue and experience for everyone. We do not tolerate any form of harassment of event participants.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, physical appearance, age, race, ethnicity, political affiliation, national origin, or religion. Harassment also includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, unwelcome following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event organizer immediately. Organizers can be recognized by special apparel and/or lanyards and name badges.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all OHI/O events. We value your attendence!
