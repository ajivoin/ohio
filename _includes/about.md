# OHI/O's Mission  
The OHI/O Program fosters a tech culture at Ohio State and its surrounding communities, ultimately providing students the opportunity to learn and build with real technologies outside of the classroom. Through the platform, OHI/O better connects students to real world problems and opportunities by engaging with the community and industry partners.

# OHI/O History + Vision  
OHI/O aims to enhance the student learning experience and engagement between students, community members, industry professionals, alumni and staff. OHI/O emphasizes providing students an informal and diverse learning platform regardless of experience or background. The OHI/O organizers possess a fundamental belief in the power of creation and are dedicated to empowering students to develop skills such as technical ability, communication, creativity, and critical thinking. In other words: to grow the excitement, the camaraderie, and access to resources for the thinkers, the makers, and the do-ers of OSU.
  
Beginning with the university's first hackathon in 2013, the annual event has grown from 100 students in the library basement, to 200 students in 2014, and most recently to 500+ students in 17,389 sqft Ohio Union Ballroom.
In addition to the flagship hackathon, the OHI/O platform introduced satellite events in 2014 hosting Ohio State's first hardware focused hackathon the Makeathon. In 2015, OHI/O sponsored Ohio State students to attend GiveBackHack, a local hackathon focused on social entrepreneurship. Through promoting and supporting additional tech events both on and off campus, such as TownHacks and DataFest, OHI/O aims enhance the student learning experience and engagement between students, community members, industry professionals, alumni and staff.
